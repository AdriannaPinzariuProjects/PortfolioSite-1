The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. GameModel: This class will manage the state of the game. It will have methods to update the position and movement of the player's ship, enemies, and projectiles, as well as the state of the game (like score, game over condition, etc.).

2. GameView: This class will manage rendering the game state onto the screen. It will use the data from the GameModel to visualize the player's ship, the enemies, and the projectiles at their current positions. It may also display other game data, like the player's score.

3. GameController: This class will handle user input and translate it into model updates. It will capture arrow key events for controlling the player's ship and the space bar event for shooting projectiles.

4. main.js: This will be the entry point of the game. It will create instances of the GameModel, GameView, and GameController classes and start the game loop.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

main.js
